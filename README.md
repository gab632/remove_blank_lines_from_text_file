A simple Java method to remove blank lines from a text file. 
The path of the text file is entered via CLI. 
An outputfile is created in the same directory of the input file. 
The output file does not contain blank lines. 

The code has been created using Amazon Q developer AI agent.
I just edited some details, such as:
  Adjusted the parameters of the method, by using just one input parameter, the input file name.
  Splitted the code to get the extension of he iput file, by creating the getExtension() method.
